# ðŸª™ Coin-Toss Monte Carlo Simulation

This project simulates repeated biased coin tosses using Monte Carlo methods to analyze:
- The proportion of successes (1s) in each trial
- The distribution of longest streaks of consecutive 1s

It uses Python with `random`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, and visualizes how bias (e.g., 90% success) impacts streak length and outcome distribution.
